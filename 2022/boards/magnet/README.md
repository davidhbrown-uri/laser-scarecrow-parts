## Magnet sensor board supplemental README

**Caution** I could not easily find the files I uploaded originally so I have recreated them here. No changes were made to the source file before exporting.

Note that the gerbers are "panelized" to produce a 3x10 grid of these tiny boards. This may or may not work for vendors other than JLCPCB.
