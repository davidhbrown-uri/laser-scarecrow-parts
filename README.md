# laser-scarecrow-parts
Custom-manufactured parts for the URI Laser Scarecrow. Includes stl files for 3D-printed parts and Gerbers for circuit boards.

Does *not* include designs for custom tooling we use to more easily create large numbers of parts for production of research kits. If that's something you think you need, we should talk as it is the project's hope that reasonably priced laser scarecrows will become commercially available to growers.
